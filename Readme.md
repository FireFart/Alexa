# Alexa

This repository contains some alexa skills for playing around with some echos and see what's possible using skills.

The skills are using the `Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Python` because I hate NodeJS and there is no golang SDK available yet.

Sadly most of the examples are NodeJS based so feel free to take this repository as a reference for Python based skills and learn from it.
